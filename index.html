                    <p>Hi, my name is Kyra Lu. I am currently a Master student in Computer Science at Northeastern University. From a young age, I was drawn to dismantling toys to understand how they worked and fix them. These early experiences sparked my interest in electrical engineering.</p>
                    <p>That is why I finished my undergrad study in electrical engineering, where I delved into the world of circuits, energy systems, and automation. Fortunately, I got to intern at a robotics company and worked on projects that greatly improved automated industrial processes with Python. Gradually, I couldn't ignore the ever-expanding role of software in these systems.</p>
                    <p>So, here I am today, embarking on a master's degree in computer science at NEU. I envision a future where machines can not only operate efficiently but also adapt, learn, and make intelligent decisions. I want to be at the forefront of this transformation.</p>
                    <p>Right now, I am actively seeking for opportunities, mentorship, and internships to bring my vision to life. With a solid foundation in electrical engineering and a fervent passion for computer science, I'm committed to electrifying the future.</p>
